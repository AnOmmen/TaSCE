                    TaSCE (Tabletop Simulator Card Exporter)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    When using a third-party software, like Magic Set Editor, to develop cards
for Tabletop Simulator, I found it tedious to then import my cards into the
provided mod tools for the game just so that I can export them into texture
file. TaSCE is designed so that a user can cirucmvent that additional step if
he or she seeks to use a third-party software for development.
